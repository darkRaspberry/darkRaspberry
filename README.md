 - 🔭 I have killed more apps than Google ever created. I'm try to make a small game for 2 years. Do you believe me? I hate that project now. Currently [this](https://github.com/users/darkRaspberry/projects/1) is I'm working on.

#### Do you have any blog?
I write about *What is good developing environment?*. With some taste of privacy, cryptography, and everything related to that. Basically it says "How a app should behave."
