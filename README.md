 - 👨‍💻 I primarily write code *ON* and *FOR* Penguin(s)🐧 only.
 - Skill📜? I know bash, NodeJS, HTML, SASS & little bit python. I have a wide knowledge how to use linux and its build in components.
 - I have vast knowledge about how to use Cloudflare, aws, gcloud and any other web services.
 - 🔭 I have killed more apps than Google ever created. I'm trying to make a small game for 3 years. Do you believe me? I hate that project now. Currently [this](https://github.com/users/darkRaspberry/projects/1) is I'm working on.
