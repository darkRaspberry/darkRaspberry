### Hi Fellow Nerd 👋

You know me, right! don't you.

 - 👨‍💻 I primarily write code *ON* and *FOR* Penguin(s)🐧 only.
 - 📫To reach me drop a mail at [![Mail 📩📧](../../blob/main/src/gmail.png)](mailto:insidedarkpit@gmail.com?subject=I%20wanna%20know%20about%20ProfileReadme)
 - 🔭 I have killed more apps than Google ever created. I'm try to make a small game for 3 years. Do you believe me? I hate that project now. Currently [this](https://github.com/users/darkRaspberry/projects/1) is I'm working on.
 - ✏️ In non-technical, I write poems📒 & know how to solve Rubik's cube and nasty quotes📝 and trying to be a Guitarist🎸(Tip-Don't be a guitarist, It hurts).

 - I recently started studying cyber security and already at *[0xD][GOD]* in [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/darkRaspberry).

#### Do you have any blog?
I write about *What is good developing environment?*. With some taste of privacy, cryptography, and everything related to that. May be you wanna look at it.
